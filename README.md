This was a project to create a website for my families business. It was a design contribution I challenged myself to prepare with web development/front-end development skills. All throughout this site (made to be responsive) there are sliders, animation effects, js form designs, drop-down menus and more. All these visual effects were built off HTML5 & CSS, and optimized using the CSS framework called Bootstrap.

Feel free to menuver around my artistic expressions (code) and enjoy :)!
